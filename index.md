# Welcome

I am **Meiyi Li**, a Ph.D. candidate in Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at **The University of Texas at Austin**, advised by [Prof. Javad Mohammadi](https://javadm-utexas.github.io/Homepage/).  
My research focuses on **machine learning and optimization for decision-making under uncertainty** in power systems, sensor networks, smart cities, and electricity-dependent mobility systems.  
I am especially interested in building **trustworthy and sustainable AI** for large-scale cyber-physical infrastructures.
